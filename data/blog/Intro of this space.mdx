## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to my blog. I'm Shaowu Tang, a Research Assistant at SZTU and an incoming Ph.D. student at USC. You can read more about my background and research experence [here](https://shaowutang.com/).

This blog is mainly a space for me to document thoughts on research, technology, life, and anything else that comes to mind. It's more of a personal notebook of sorts â€” if anyone else happens to find it interesting, that's a bonus.

## Some Rants
I'm not a professional programmer, although I have over 6 years of experience writing code for robotic systems. While building this Blog site, I ran into some really frustrating and confusing issues: In <code>.tsx</code> files, even extra spaces and line breaks are treated as syntax errors?!

I hate TypeScript!
