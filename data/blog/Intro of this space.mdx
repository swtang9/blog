## Introduction
Hi there! I'm Shaowu Tang, an incoming Ph.D. student at USC, welcome to my blog. 

Here I will record some of my my wild thoughts on scientific research, technology, life experiences, and more. I hope this blog can become a space where we can learn and grow together.

## Some Rants
I'm not a professional programmer, although I have over 6 years of experience writing code for robotic systems. While building this Blog site, I ran into some really frustrating and confusing issues: In <code>.tsx</code> files, even extra spaces and line breaks are treated as syntax errors?!

Honestly, I hate TypeScript!
